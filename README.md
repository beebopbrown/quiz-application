## About
I wasn't able to put in as much time before the deadline as I hoped so I scaled back my feature
set to get the submission done in time for the deadline. I will be adding the features listed in the
To Do's section.

## Requirements
1. Install NodeJS and NPM [here](https://nodejs.org) <br />
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/beebopbrown/quiz-application.git` <br />
3. `cd /directory/to/application && npm install` <br />
4. `npm start` to start the application <br />
5. Go to **localhost:3000** to view the site 

## To Do's
1. Add more questions to the bank
2. Implement random questions
3. Add categories of quizes that the user can select.
4. Re-factor
5. Add better styles
